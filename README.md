## User Experience

### Project Aims

The initial aims of the project were to create an e-commerce website for an imaginary company called Island Bees, a North Wales based apiary and merchants, who stock a variety of good relating to bee-keeping as well as running courses for bee keepers. The website's main purpose was to allow customers to browse the company's products and make purchases, tell the customers about Island Bees and information about their online shop and allow user interactions through reviews and messages.

### Design

#### Wireframes

#### Colour

![Website Colour Scheme](media/docs/color-pallette.jpg)

I used a colour palette of yellows and greys with a blue highlight colour to create contrast. I also added additional colours for all success/edit/info features and delete/warning/error features as well as to help categorise different statuses of messages & reviews on the profile & manage pages. I used a number of shades of the colours to help create contrast, to make the site legible and got give more flexibility in the design. The colours changed slightly during the validation stage as the yellow & grey on the rating hexagons were causing some contrast errors, so I introduced an orange tone to replace the yellow and darkened the grey hexagons to make sure the site was fully accessible.

- - -

#### Typography

The website uses 2 typefaces that I felt worked well together and complemented each other:
- [Oxygen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen) for headings & the site logo
- [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3) for the main body text

- - -

#### Images & Graphics

- **Logo:** I created a logo for the site in the shape of a simplified bee as it is a strong iconic image and gives an immediate sense of the purpose of the site and a strong brand image. I created 2 versions, one with text for larger screens and another without which works as an icon. I also created a Favicon with a yellow background using the same logo.

- **Hexagons:** There are recurring hexagon shapes and background patterns throughout the site, on the Hero image on the home page, on the bag icon in the nav bar, in the products div as a background pattern and as a rating 'star' on the products. The hexagon continues the bee theme and creates a unique graphic element that runs through the site.

- **Error Bee:** The error pages contain a bee cartoon from Freepik (see credits section) to make these pages tie in with the rest of the site.

- **No Image Graphic:** I also created a 'no-image' graphic to be used whenever a product doesn't have an image using the site logo.
