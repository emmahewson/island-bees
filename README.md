Notes

Bug - attempted to move the js for the remove item from bag in to separate JS file - update worked ok but remove didn't. Put back in to HTML as a script tag.

Bug - bag appears in toast after review updated or added - not sorted

Bug - issues with the checkout delivery & total calculations - couldn't add a float & a decimal type numbers. Converted the order_total & total_delivery_charge to floats which fixed the problem.
