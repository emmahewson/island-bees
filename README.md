## User Experience

The design of the site was a complex process, it is the biggest most expansive project I have made so far and from the beginning I wanted to approach it with the principles of User Experience Design at the heart of the process. This was the best way to break down the design in to key stages of strategy, scope, structure, skeleton & surface and to make sure the project remained on course, on time and the best it could be whilst meeting all its initial aims. I have followed those 5 stages during the design process and the results of that are detailed below.


### Project Aims

The initial aims of the project were to create an e-commerce website for an imaginary company called Island Bees, a North Wales based apiary and merchants, who stock a variety of good relating to bee-keeping as well as running courses for bee keepers. The website's main purpose was to allow customers to browse the company's products and make purchases, tell the customers about Island Bees and information about their online shop and allow user interactions through reviews and messages.

### Design

#### Flow Diagram

I created a flow diagram for the structure of the site. This was an important step in the user experience design process, working out the structure and skeleton of the site, to provide the best user experience, thinking through the paths of users through the site, what would need to link to where and to make sure the site functioned as expected and everything was easy to find. It was also a vital tool to manage the scope of the project during the design and development stages, a blueprint to keep everything on track.

#### Colour

![Website Colour Scheme](media/docs/design_color.jpg)

I used a colour palette of yellows and greys with a blue highlight colour to create contrast. I also added additional colours for all success/edit/info features and delete/warning/error features as well as to help categorise different statuses of messages & reviews on the profile & manage pages. I used a number of shades of the colours to help create contrast, to make the site legible and got give more flexibility in the design. The colours changed slightly during the validation stage as the yellow & grey on the rating hexagons were causing some contrast errors, so I introduced an orange tone to replace the yellow and darkened the grey hexagons to make sure the site was fully accessible.

- - -

#### Typography

The website uses 2 typefaces that I felt worked well together and complemented each other:
- [Oxygen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen) for headings & the site logo
- [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3) for the main body text

- - -

#### Images & Graphics

- **Logo:** I created a logo for the site in the shape of a simplified bee as it is a strong iconic image and gives an immediate sense of the purpose of the site and a strong brand image. I created 2 versions, one with text for larger screens and another without which works as an icon. I also created a Favicon with a yellow background using the same logo.

- **Hexagons:** There are recurring hexagon shapes and background patterns throughout the site, on the Hero image on the home page, on the bag icon in the nav bar, in the products div as a background pattern and as a rating 'star' on the products. The hexagon continues the bee theme and creates a unique graphic element that runs through the site.

- **Error Bee:** The error pages contain a bee cartoon from Freepik (see credits section) to make these pages tie in with the rest of the site.

- **No Image Graphic:** I also created a 'no-image' graphic to be used whenever a product doesn't have an image using the site logo.

## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub repository allows you to create a duplicate repository in order to make changes without affecting the original.

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [Island Bees GitHub repository](https://github.com/emmahewson/island-bees)
2. Click on Fork (top right) to fork the repository
3. Give the fork a name and description if you wish and click "Create Fork"
4. You can now open the repository in your IDE of choice e.g. GitPod
5. Once in your IDE you can install the project requirements from the requirements.txt file using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

---

### Making a Local Clone

A local clone allows you to create a copy of the project to work on locally on your own computer in your code editor of choice (e.g. VS Code)

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [Island Bees GitHub repository](https://github.com/emmahewson/island-bees)
2. Click on "Code"
3. To clone using HTTPS copy the provided link on the HTTPS tab
4. Open your own terminal for your coding environment (making sure you have Git installed)
5. Set your current directory to the location you want to store your new clone
6. Type `git clone`, followed by the copied link you copied from GitHub e.g. `git clone https://github.com/emmahewson/island-bees.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone of the project
8. Set up your local development environment
9. Install the project requirements from the requirements.txt file in the project using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
10. Create your own env.py file containing all the required environment variables
11. You are now ready to start working on your own clone of the project - enjoy!


For more details and information go to GitHub's useful guide to [cloning repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)

---

### Deploying Your App

Deployment allows you to transfer your project from your local environment or IDE to hosting it publicly for other people to view and enjoy. There are certain steps you will need to take to do this and they are detailed below. These instructions are based on using an IDE like GitPod and having followed the instructions for Forking the repository above, especially installing the requirements. For users wishing to deploy from a local clone different steps may be required which will depend on your local development environment.

#### Setting up a Database

When working on the app in GitPod a local database (sqlite) is used which will not be available on the deployed app. You will need to set up a separate database for the deployed site.

1. Go to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and click on 'get a managed database'
2. Select 'Tiny Turtle'
3. Sign in using your GitHub account & authorise ElephantSQL to access your GitHub account
4. Set up a team and go through the login credential process or log in if you already have an account
5. Once you are logged in name your plan (usually the project name)
6. Select your nearest region
7. If you're happy click on 'create instance'
8. Go to your dashboard (click on the ElephantSQL logo) and click on the instance name
9. Copy the database URL... you will need this for the next steps

---

#### Set up Heroku & connecting your new Database


1. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and log in (or set up an account if you don't have one - please note you may incur charges for using Heroku)
2. Click on the 'New' button then 'create new app'
3. Name your app and select your nearest region
4. With your app set up go to the app's settings tab and under config variable click on 'reveal config variables' and add a new variable with the Key of `DATABASE_URL` and the value as the database URL that you copied from ElephantSQL
5. Back in GitPod go to settings.py and paste the following in to your DATABASE section to tell it to connect to the new database **Note - do not push your code to GitHub whilst this value is in your settings.py, it is a secret value that must not be shared, we will remove it later**

```
DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('your elephanySQL database url here'))
    }
```

6. In you GitPod terminal type `python3 manage.py showmigrations` to check you are connected to the new database, if you are you will see a list of migrations with no ticks next to them
7. Run the following command `python3 manage.py migrate` to migrate the database structure from your project to the new database
8. Any data that you have added to your SQLite database will not transfer to the new one. You will need to populate the site on the deployed app once it is up and running or using Fixtures (JSON files with all your database content) if you have them. You can find out more about Fixtures and how to use them in the [Django documentation.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/initial-data/#:~:text=you%20use%20TransactionTestCase.-,fixtures%20.,the%20manage.py%20dumpdata%20command.)
9. Create a superuser for your deployed site and new database (this will allow you to check if the database is working and access the site admin on the deployed site) using the following command in the terminal: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and set up login details for them following the instructions.
10. Go to the ElephanySQL site, click on your database, go to the browser tab and click on 'table queries' and select 'auth_user (public)' and click on execute, you should see your newly created user.
11. You now need to remove your new database settings from settings.py and set it up to know which version of the site you are on (development or live) to know which database to use. Go back to your GitPod dashboard, click on your avatar to go your your GitPod user settings and select 'variables'
12. Add a key of DEVELOPMENT and a value of True
13. Got to your settings.py file to the DATABASES section and replace what's there with the following code (this checks to see if there is a value called DEVELOPMENT in your environment variables - ie your development environment, rather than the deployed app and sets the database accordingly.)

```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```

14. Now that you have removed your ElephantSQL database url from the settings.py file it is safe to push your code to GitHub again. Your deployed database is set up and GitPod knows which one to use for which version of the site.


#### Deploying to Heroku

1. Create a Procfile in your app in the root directory with the following content `web: gunicorn island_bees.wsgi:application` and a blank line at the end.
2. Log in to Heroku using the GitPod terminal using the command `Heroku login`` and enter your Heroku email and password
  - if you have 2 factor authentication set up you will need to use `Heroku login -i` followed by your email and your Heroku API key as the password which you can find in your account settings on Heroku
4. Temporarily disable Heroku from collecting static files during deployment using the command `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name`
5. Commit your changes to GitHub using `git add .`, `git commit` & `git push` in the terminal
6. Then to deploy your site to Heroku use the command `git push Heroku main`
7. Your site will now be deployed without any of the static files (CSS, JavaScript & Media files)
8. In Heroku go to your app, click on activity to check if it has finished deploying and once it has go to the settings tab
9. Scroll down to 'Domains' and copy the 'your app can be found at' URL
10. Back in GitPod go to settings.py and add your deployed site's URL to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list
11. `git add .`, `git commit` & `git push` again and then `git push Heroku main` to push your changes
12. Once the site has finished deploying you should be able to navigate to the deployed site's URL and see your site content, though it will be a little strange-looking without CSS & media files!
13. You now need to replace the Django secret key in your settings.py (if you included it there) with an environment variable to keep it safe. To do this you can use a Django secret key generator online e.g. [djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/), copy the key it provides.
14. Go to your Heroku app's dashboard, open settings and reveal config variables and add a new variable with a key of SECRET_KEY and a value of what you just copied.
15. In GitPod, if you have used your secret key in settings.py, go back to your GitPod dashboard, click on your avatar to go your your GitPod user settings and select 'variables'
16. Add a key of SECRET_KEY and a value of a different Django secret key from your online key generator (djecrety or similar)
17. In settings.py and change the SECRET_KEY to `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')`
18. Below it change the value of DEBUG to the following `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ` to dynamically change whether the app is in DEBUG mode depending on whether it is the development or deployed site
19. `git add .`, `git commit` & `git push` again and then `git push Heroku main` to push your changes
20. You can also tell Heroku to automatically deploy so you don't need to push changes to both GitHub and Heroku each time - you'll find this under the Deploy tab on your Heroku app.


#### Setting Up Your Static Files on Your Deployed Site using Amazon Web Services (AWS)

There are many options for storing your static files for a deployed site, below are the instructions for using Amazon Web Services as a cloud storage provider.

1. Create an AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Select a personal account for the account type). You will need to fill in your information and card details to set up an account
2. Once your account is set up and you're signed in search for s3 in the search bar
3. Click on 'create bucket' and name it to match your Heroku app, selecting your closest region and uncheck 'block all public access' then click on create bucket to set it up
4. Click on your new bucket name and go to the properties tab
5. Scroll to the bottom and click on the edit button by 'Static Website Hosting' and select 'enable', giving default values for the index and error documents (index.html & error.html) then click save changes.
6. Go to the permissions tab and copy the ARN value at the top.
7. Scroll down to the bucket policy section, select 'edit' and 'policy generator'
8. Select 'S3 bucket policy' from the dropdown
9. In principles put a * to allow all
10. Set the action to 'Get Object'
11. Paste the earlier ARN value in the ARN input
12. Click on 'add statement' then 'generate policy'
13. Copy the policy text that the generator creates
14. Back in your bucket settings (should still be open in another tab) paste the text in to the Bucket Policy empty text area then add a '/*' to the end of the resource value (which should have your bucket name in it) this will allow access to all the resources in the bucket and click save
15. Scroll down to the access control list and grant Read and Write access to Everyone (public access) by checking the boxes
16. Scroll down to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) section and paste in the following and save:

```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

17. Go back to your AWS dashboard by clicking on the AWS logo at the top left and type in IAM in the search bar and select the IAM service
18. Click on the user groups tab and create a new group, with the name of your choice, ideally with your app name in it and create the group
19. Go to the policies tab and create a policy, go the JSON tab and search for the S3FullAccess policy and import it
20. Edit the policy to the following:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

21. Click on next and then review
22. Name the policy and give it a description and then create your policy
23. Go to the User Groups tab, select your group and go to permissions and click 'add permissions' then 'attach policy' selecting your newly created policy and clicking 'Attach policies'
24. Create a user for the group by going to the User tab and clicking 'create user'
25. Name your user (you don't need to select AWS Console access) click next and add your user to your group clicking next as required and 'create user'
26. Download and save the csv file with the user's credentials - this is important, you will not be able to access this information again
27. Back in GitPod go to your settings.py file and paste in the following code which tells the app to look for an environment variable called USE_AWS and if it's there to use the following settings to access the static files.

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'island-bees'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```
28. Set up the following config variables in Heroku using the information in the csv file that you downloaded:
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: *your access key value*
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: *your secret access key value*
  - USE_AWS: True
29. Remove COLLECTSTATIC from the config variables in Heroku
30. Back in GitPod create a file called custom_storages.py in the root directory and add the following:

```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

```

31. In settings.py add the following to tell it to look for the new storage classes we just created in custom_storages and to override the URLS for static and media files. Put this just below the AWS code from earlier within the if `'USE_AWS' in os.environ` statement.

```
# Static and media files
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

# Override static and media URLs in production
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

32. You're nearly there! Save your settings.py then push to add/commit/push to GitHub (if you've set up automatic deploys you won't need to also push to Heroku)
33. Once the deployment has finished check your S3 bucket, there should be a static folder in there with your static files (CSS / JS folders with files inside) and the live site should now have its CSS styling and any JavaScript functionality.
34. Finally to add your media files (images & video) simply go back to AWS, create a new folder called 'media' in the same place as the new 'static' folder, click on the folder and drag and drop all your media files in to the browser window.
35. Click next and under manage public permissions select 'grant public access to these objects' and click upload
35. Your site should now contain all your images, videos, styling and JavaScript! Well done!
